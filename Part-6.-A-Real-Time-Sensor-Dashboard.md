##Overview

This is the fun section where we put everything we learned in the previous sections together to create something that really starts to show the power of the Internet of Things. You will learn how easy it is to create a custom dashboard that lets you see all of your sensor/IoT data at-a-glance. You will learn how to instantly turn your sensor/IoT data into bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, histograms, etc. You will even learn how to make your sensor/IoT devices speak emojis ðŸ˜›. If you got this far, you would be crazy to skip this section. 

This Section will cover:
