The DS18B20 has three wires. The red wire connects to 3.3V. The blue/black wire connects to ground. The yellow wire connects to a pull-up resistor/pin 4.

> If you have a DS18B20 that has red/black/blue wires, red to 3.3V, black to ground, and blue to pull-up resistor/pin 4._Make sure your Pi is powered off before putting together your circuit._
