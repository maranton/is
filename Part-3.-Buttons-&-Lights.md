##Overview

One of the coolest aspects of the Pi is that we can build and attach circuits that it can talk to. We are going to use a breadboard to quickly build circuits that can be controlled from simple Python scripts running on the Pi. We will build a circuit that drives an input into the Pi, a button, as well as a circuit that the Pi drives as an output, a LED. Each circuit will have a simple Python script that we will run to control it.
