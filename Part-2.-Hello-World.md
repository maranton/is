##Overview
The Pi can do so many amazing things, too many to cover in a single workshop. We are going to focus on using our Pi to build an Internet of Things (IoT) application. This means we will want to be able to remotely access our Pi from our laptop through its Internet connection to modify code and execute programs. Letâ€™s get familiar with the command prompt and a command-line friendly text editor to write our first Python script to run on our Pi. If you are already familiar with using a Linux command prompt, SSH, and running a basic Python script, feel free to fast-forward to Section 3 where things will get much more interesting for you.

Here's what we'll cover in Part 2:
- [SSH](Part-2.-SSH)
- [Python + Nano](Part-2.Python+Nano)
