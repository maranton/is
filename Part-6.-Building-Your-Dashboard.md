Go to your Initial State account and you should see a new data bucket named "ðŸ’» sensors". The first thing to notice is that your bucket name has an emoji in it. Look at line 9 of sensors.py:

```python
BUCKET_NAME = ":computer: Sensors"
```

The ```:computer:``` part of the bucket name is an emoji token that gets replaced with the actual emoji when displayed. You can get a list of all emoji tokens at [http://emoji.codes](http://emoji.codes). You can use emoji tokens in bucket names, signal/stream names, and signal/stream values.

Click on the "ðŸ’» sensors" data bucket and select the Tiles visualization. You will see something similar to the following the first time you load Tiles:
