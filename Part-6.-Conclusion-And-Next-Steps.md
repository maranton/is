If you made it this far and completed every section, you just built something that, not long ago, took an entire engineering team months to build. Congratulations!! 

## Next Step
piot 101 introduced you to a LOT of topics including Pi, breadboards, Python, Unix, Github, data streaming, data visualizations, and more. The follow-on workshop is called piot at home and walks you through building practical smart home devices using Pi and Arduino devices. This workshop is a 4-week, hands-on workshop where you get to go in-depth on the topics that piot 101 introduced. You will have access to mentors and other people going through the same workshop to help you build the foundation of practical IoT and Maker skills. When you are done with the course, you will have built some pretty awesome devices that you will use every day in your home. We only take 10 people per workshop to ensure that everyone gets the training and attention they need. To learn more and get on the waiting list, go to http://www.piot.io/athome/.
